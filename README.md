My personal fork of nnn, with some tweaks. This mainly serves to house my plugins and keybinds.

###Current roadmap (subject to change):
[x] Changes to keybinds
[x] Slightly alter default mv/cp flags
[x] Copy/paste/move files with sudo privileges
[x] Generate .torrent files with mktorrent
[] Sysz integration
[] Ability to remap nnn keybinds on the fly (might not be doable?)
[] Flexible templates for new files
[] Systemd drop-in file creator
[] Spawn shell in new/existing ssh session
[] Whatever else annoys me in my daily workflow (TBD)
